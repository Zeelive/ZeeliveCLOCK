# ZeeliveCLOCK
I made a virtual Analog Clock using JavaScript and no frameworks since I thought people would forget about the analog clock.
You get a different ZEELIVEimage each time you press the "Party Time!" button throughout the time frame you choose. There are seven images total, and you can select different times to view each one.
